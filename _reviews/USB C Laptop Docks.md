## Considerations:
- Power Delivery
- Ports


## What you need to know:
- How much Power, measured in Watts, does your laptop need?
    - 65 Watts is typical
    - A small Macbook air is 30 Watts, a gaming laptop with a dedicated GPU can be 100 Watts or more
    - Usually, a small laptop can use a large power supply and it will only consume what it needs. A large laptop will charge slowly from a small power supply and under heavy loads the battery may still run down
- What accessories will you be connecting?
    - HDMI or DP monitor
    - USB A devices
    - USB C devices
    - Ethernet
    - SD cards
